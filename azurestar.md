# Welcome to the World of Azure Star!

Azure Star is a story concept I have been developing for a few years. It is a medieval fantasy story with magic, action, and adventure. I'll give a brief synopsis: 

After losing her home during a violent rebellion, Neoma embarks on a journey of vengeance and political deception as she infiltrates the ranks of the magic academy to deliver justice. On her journey, Neoma, now known as Malina, will uncover hidden truths behind the rebellion, rediscover herself as she regains faith in allies, and venture the farthest reaches of the world.
